# Hipster Cat

 - is my cat cool feature?, if it gets walked enough and has a cat sweater?
 - take my cat for a walk, takes like 10 seconds and the cat moves back and forth, could work well for a scrolling terminal style game or doesnt matter just display anything
   - show determining...... with adding ...'s ass you wait

 - you can move to la if you have enough credits
 - might want city model that links to different stuff i have to create and put in

 - different apartments in brooklyn, not that many, bedford ave, brooklyn heights, bushwick, bed stoy

 - visually can use pong engine?

 - go see a show/bike/activity model, apply to a new designer job, sponsor a shelter cat, adopt a shelter cat


 - fixed gear bike model, and accessories

 - earn credits or money, same thing, with your job, to earn money you have to do an annoying minigame, like it'll say press 1 and you have to press 1 then says type apple, then it says add 2+2, a little quiz if you pass then you get the money
    - will need a quiz model , when you pass the quiz it adds money to your player, a quiz model dont save results
    - or don't do this quiz thing, just something to slow now adding money , use random number generator to force user to input a super long number


 say todays date, have initial interface just be poker style, or bad minesweeper, just print out all the stats


 - check app academy cat programs for best stuff
