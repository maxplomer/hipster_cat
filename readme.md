# Hipster Cat


Hipster Cat is a prototype pure Ruby game that leans heavily on OOP design to create a virtual world where a user can adopt cats, get a job, move from the suburbs to Brooklyn or LA, even take their cat for a walk if they choose.  Itâ€™s a playground for fun Ruby code; for instance, using a Gaussian distribution to give cats up for adoption an average age of 8 with standard deviation of 2 years.
